  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>
    This page is written in English.
    It helps me understand how a website is structured.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this page exists</h2>

  <p>
    I am learning how to code step by step.
    Each HTML file represents a page of a website.
  </p>

  <h2>What I have learned</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A file is a page</li>
    <li>HTML is structure</li>
    <li>The browser reads the file and displays the content</li>
  </ul>
